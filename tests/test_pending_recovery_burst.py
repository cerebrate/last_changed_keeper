"""Tests for the boot-pending recovery burst: entities that were pending at
boot (unavailable/unknown when the boot pass ran) get a second chance via a
persistent listener for their unavailable→real transition. Individual
transitions are debounce-coalesced into a burst set and drained together
(see _drain_pending_recovery_burst) instead of firing one recorder query per
entity, the same treatment P3.1 gave the re-registration listener.
